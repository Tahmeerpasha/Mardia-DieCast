                In Pressure Die Casting machine and Plastic Injection Molding machine, there are fixed platen and moving
                platen which over a period of time surface gets damaged and dents are formed. So, this portable milling
                machine(PMM), will be fixed on the die casting machine and it will machine the platen at the client{"'"}s site.
                Without dismantling the platen within 24 hours the job gets completed.

                <li>Machining can be done at your site.</li>
                <li>Requires none or minimal dismantling of large equipment{"’"}s.</li>
                <li>Eliminates the need for transport, hence saves on time and costs.</li>
                <li>Overall time and cost reduced, without compromising on quality.</li>
                <li>Geometrical accuracy achievable within 0.2mm parallelism.</li>
                <li>It can remove all kinds of dents on the surface of fixed platen and moving platen.</li>
                <li>Repair activity we can do it within 24 hours on a single platen.</li>
                <li>T-slot repairing can be taken up, if required addition to slot{"’"}s also can be made.</li>
                <li>We can do this job up to 1100-ton machine.</li>
                <li>Fixing of false or sub platen can be done on site.</li>
